Hi, I’m Christian 👋

I’m a senior frontend-focused full-stack engineer based in 📍 Cologne, Germany, with 10+ years of professional experience building and maintaining web applications.

My background is rooted in frontend engineering, design systems, and developer experience, but I’m comfortable owning features end-to-end when it makes sense. Over the years I’ve worked on everything from component libraries and internal frameworks to full business applications.

I care about clean architecture, pragmatic solutions, and software that is pleasant to use and maintain.
